## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Julien (aka yebor974), a passionate software engineer from Reunion Island, France. With solid expertise in web development, I specialize particularly in Laravel and FilamentPHP.

## My Journey ðŸš€

- **Software Engineer** with several years of experience in development, project management, and training.
- **Creator of @Laravel and @FilamentPHP plugins**, actively contributing to the open-source community to enhance the developer experience.

## Why I Create ðŸŒŸ

- **Passion for Development**: I love coding and exploring new technologies. @Laravel and @FilamentPHP are my favorite playgrounds.
- **Community**: I believe in the power of the open-source community and strive to contribute by creating useful plugins for @FilamentPHP.
- **Education**: I also create tutorials to help developers use @FilamentPHP plugins more effectively and participate in jury sessions to qualify future developers at schools.

## My Goal ðŸ’¼

- **Independent**: I am currently working on developing my activity as a freelancer. Support through GitHub Sponsors will help me dedicate more time to creating quality plugins and participating in open-source projects.
- **Business Analysis and Project Management**: I love project management and also work as a Business Analyst (AMOA), helping companies successfully complete their IT projects.
